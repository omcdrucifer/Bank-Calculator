This is a savings and loan calculator that I started on my own but am now incorporating into a portfolio 
project for Codecademy CS certification

This code will be fleshed out to be a more interactive application that is used in a terminal.

Most recent iteration now has a title screen and a welcome message that explains what the application
is about. The underlying logic is unchanged as I wrote the print statements as functions in a separate file
to be imported into the main file wherein I just had to create print objects and print functions.

At this point I think I've done as much as I can with this little program. It probably went a bit faster than the course designers intended. But being that I had a week head start and decided it fit the criteria of the assignment, I decided to just build on what I already had.
