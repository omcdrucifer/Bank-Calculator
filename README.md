# Bank Calculator Terminal App and AppImage

The program currently exists in two different versions:

0.1.2 - Terminal App

I was tasked with creating a terminal Python app for Codecademy's CS Cert. It is a simple script that you can just download and execute in terminal. 


1.0.0 - FICalc AppImage

I wanted to learn tkinter and pyinstall, so I built a GUI and packaged it as an AppImage. It can be found in the folder labeled "bank_calculator_app" along with its 'build' and 'dist' folders.
