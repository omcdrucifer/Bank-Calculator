A GUI version of the Python terminal app I wrote to calculate loans and savings

Version 1.0.0 of the GUI app

This version is a Linux AppImage. I intend to make a Windows EXE also

Just download, make sure to give it executable permission with `chmod u+x FICalc`

This is a very simple app that was more so a portfolio project than intended to be a fully functional \
program. But I wanted to learn how to use tkinter and pyinstaller so I made a wrapper. 

Thanks for trying and enjoy!
