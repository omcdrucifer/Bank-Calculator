This is a simple bank calculator tool that I wrote in Python.

In its current state 0.1.0, it can calculate loan payments, interest paid, and dividends for deposit
accounts. 

Running 'bank_calculator.py' will run the whole application in its intended form. However, as these are 
Python packages, they can be imported and used in other files as well.
